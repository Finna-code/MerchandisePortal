# Wireframe Overview

This folder contains low-fidelity wireframes for the core flows of the merchandise portal. Each wireframe focuses on information hierarchy and key interactions rather than visual styling.

## Included Screens
- Landing page hero and featured products (Landing.md).
- Catalog browsing experience with filtering and cart entry points (Catalog.md).
- Product detail page with reviews and department actions (ProductDetail.md).
- Checkout flow covering cart, address/payment, and confirmation (Checkout.md).

All wireframes use simple ASCII blocks so they can be viewed without external design tools. Stakeholders can map these structures to high-fidelity designs documented in docs/Design.md.
